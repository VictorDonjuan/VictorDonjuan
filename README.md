### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VictorDonjuan. 

I'm a mathematician who has fallen in love with programming and data science over the past few years. I created this GitHub to start my career as a data scientist. I'm storing my projects here, and will probably keep coming with new stuff from here on out. Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-donjuan-arroyo/).

### My skills include:

- Python
- SQL
- Machine Learning 
- Deep Learning
